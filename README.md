# CashuCards
**Greeting Cards give bitcoin using the Cashu protocol.**

I wrote about creating greeting cards designed to pay people in bitcoin with Cashu. I plan on selling these, but I like the ethos of open source so I decided to open source my cards. I will still sell them, but I also want people to create cards themselves. That will get more sats in the hands of more nieces and nephews. That's the ultimate goal really.

## How It Works:
I wrote some birthday cards and used AI to generate the images for my text. Here is how to use them:

1. Download the card.
2. Print the card on a color printer using double-sided portrait mode.
3. Cut the cards in half.
4. Create [cashu](https://cashu.space/)
5. Turn the cashu into a QR code. I use [QtQR](https://github.com/ralgozino/qtqr)
6. Adjust the size to ensure it fits onto the card.
7. Print the QR code onto a piece of paper
8. Cut and paste the paper QR code onto the card.
9. Place the card into an envelope and give it to someone. I use 4.37x5.75 envelopes.
