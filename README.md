# CashuCards
**Greeting Cards give bitcoin using the Cashu protocol.**

I wrote about creating greeting cards designed to pay people in bitcoin with Cashu. I plan on selling these, but I like the ethos of open source so I decided to open source my cards. I will still sell them, but I also want people to create cards themselves. That will get more sats in the hands of more nieces and nephews. That's the ultimate goal really.

## How It Works:
I wrote some birthday cards ~~and used AI to generate the images for my text~~. [Nostr](https://nostr.how) native artist, [Bitpopart](https://nostree.me/npub1gwa27rpgum8mr9d30msg8cv7kwj2lhav2nvmdwh3wqnsa5vnudxqlta2sz) saw the project and drew some cashu cartoon characters and shared them with me on nostr. He also transforms the text. 



Here is how to use them:

1. Download the card.
2. Print the card on a color printer using double-sided portrait mode.
3. Cut the cards in half.
4. Create [cashu](https://cashu.space/)
5. Turn the cashu into a QR code. I use [QTQR](https://github.com/ralgozino/qtqr)
6. Adjust the size to ensure it fits onto the card.
7. Print the QR code onto a piece of paper
8. Cut and paste the paper QR code onto the card.
9. Place the card into an envelope and give it to someone. I use 4.37x5.75 envelopes.

 ### How To Print The Gift Cards:
 I currently have images for the front and back of a card. You can cut them yourself or buy Avery 5163 cards if you prefer. First print the front.
 In my inkjet printer, I place the printed paper back in the tray front side up. Then I print the back side. Printers may very. It's a good idea to print a test page to verify how your printer works.

 The **gift cards were created using glabels** which can be found at https://github.com/jimevins/glabels-qt.

 ### How To Add E Cash
 I print QR codes on sticker paper and affix them using sticker paper or a glue stick.

 #### Disclaimer:
 Cashu is in the very early days. These cards are designed for small amounts of bitcoin to be given away as gifts. It is non-custodial bitcoin that can be redeemed for bitcoin onto your own wallet over the lightning network much like a check from a bank can be redeemed or cash. Please do not use this for serious money as it is in the experimental stage of development. **It is not suitable for your life's savings**. Never put more money into cashu than you are prepared to lose.
