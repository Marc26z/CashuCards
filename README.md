# CashuCards
**Greeting Cards give bitcoin using the Cashu protocol.**

I wrote about creating greeting cards designed to pay people in bitcoin with Cashu. I plan on selling these, but I like the ethos of open source so I decided to open source my cards. I will still sell them, but I also want people to create cards themselves. That will get more sats in the hands of more nieces and nephews. That's the ultimate goal really.
