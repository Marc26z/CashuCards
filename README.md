# CashuCards
**Greeting Cards give bitcoin using the Cashu protocol.**

I wrote about creating greeting cards designed to pay people in bitcoin with Cashu. I plan on selling these, but I like the ethos of open source so I decided to open source my cards. I will still sell them, but I also want people to create cards themselves. That will get more sats in the hands of more nieces and nephews. That's the ultimate goal really.

## How It Works:
I wrote some birthday cards and used AI to generate the images for my text. Here is how to use them:

1. Download the card.
2. Print the card on a color printer using double-sided portrait mode.
3. Cut the cards in half.
4. Create [cashu](https://cashu.space/)
5. Turn the cashu into a QR code. I use [QtQR](https://github.com/ralgozino/qtqr)
6. Adjust the size to ensure it fits onto the card.
7. Print the QR code onto a piece of paper
8. Cut and paste the paper QR code onto the card.
9. Place the card into an envelope and give it to someone. I use 4.37x5.75 envelopes.

 ### How To Print The Gift Cards:
 I currently have images for the front and back of a card. You can cut them yourself or buy Avery 5163 cards if you prefer. First print the front.
 In my inkjet printer, I place the printed paper back in the tray front side up. Then I print the back side. Printers may very. It's a good idea to print a test page to verify how your printer works.

 The **gift cards were created using glabels** which can be found at https://github.com/jimevins/glabels-qt

 ### How To Add E Cash
 I print QR codes on sticker paper and affix them with 

 #### Disclaimer:
 Cashu is in the very early days. These cards are designed for small amounts of bitcoin to be given away as gifts. It is custodial bitcoin that can be redeemed for bitcoin onto your own wallet over the lightning network. Please do not use this for serious money as it is in the experimental stage of development. Never put more money into cashu than you are prepared to lose.
