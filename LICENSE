CC0

CC0 enables scientists, educators, artists and other creators and owners of copyright- or database-protected content to waive those interests in their works and thereby place them as completely as possible in the public domain, so that others may freely build upon, enhance and reuse the works for any purposes without restriction under copyright or database law.

In contrast to CC’s licenses that allow copyright holders to choose from a range of permissions while retaining their copyright, CC0 empowers yet another choice altogether – the choice to opt out of copyright and database protection, and the exclusive rights automatically granted to creators – the “no rights reserved” alternative to our licenses.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim or modified
copies of this license document.

> DON'T BE A DICK PUBLIC LICENSE
> TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be a dick.

   Being a dick includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

 1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.
 1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.
 1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.

2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
share the love. Only a dick would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's
creator(s) a pint.

3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and bitching when it goes wrong makes
you a DONKEY dick. Fix the problem yourself. A non-dick would submit the fix back.
